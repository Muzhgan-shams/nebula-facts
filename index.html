      <p>
        <strong>A nebula</strong> is a cloud of gas and dust in interstellar
        space. Every nebula contains hydrogen and helium, plus a mixture of
        other gases. There are several types of nebulae (plural of ‚Äúnebula):
        molecular clouds (also known as HII regions because they are mainly
        hydrogen), dark nebulae, supernova remnants, and planetary nebulae. Our
        galaxy has many nebulae, and astronomers have found these clouds in
        other galaxies, as well.

          Most nebulae contain the ‚Äústuff of stars and planets‚Äù, including
          gases, dust, and complex molecules.
        </li>
        <li>
          As stars die and lose their materials to space, their gases and dust
          mix with clouds of gas, creating the complex nebulae we see.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nebulae are always in motion, even though they look quiescent in
          images. The clouds mix and churn, which creates magnetic fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are several types of molecular clouds: dark globules, emission
          nebulae, and reflection nebulae emission nebulae glow as their gases
          are heated. Reflection nebulae are mostly dust which reflects the
          light from nearby stars.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our Sun and planets formed in a nebula some 4.5 billion years ago.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nebulae exist in other galaxies. Astronomers have observed them in all
          spirals as well as the nearby Magellanic Clouds.
